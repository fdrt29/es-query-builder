# Prefix Query

A prefix query returns documents that contain terms starting with the specified prefix in a given field.

### Example

```go
import (
    es "github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8"

	"github.com/sdqri/effdsl/v2"
	mppq "github.com/sdqri/effdsl/v2/queries/matchphraseprefixquery"
)

query, err := effdsl.Define(
    effdsl.WithQuery(
        mppq.MatchPhrasePrefixQuery(
            "field_name",
            "some phrase prefix query",
            mppq.WithAnalyzer("my_analyzer"),
            mppq.WithSlop(2),
            mppq.WithMaxExpansions(10),
        ),
    ),
)

res, err := es.Search(
    es.Search.WithBody(strings.NewReader(query)),
)
```
### Parameters

*   **Field (string)**  
    _(Required, positional)_ The field to search. This is a required parameter.

*   **Query (string)**  
    _(Required, positional)_ The text to search for in the provided field. This is a required parameter.

*   **WithAnalyzer (string)**  
    _(Optional, Functional option)_ Analyzer used to convert the text in the query value into tokens. Defaults to the index-time analyzer mapped for the field. If no analyzer is mapped, the indexâ€™s default analyzer is used.

*   **WithSlop (int)**  
    _(Optional, Functional option)_ Maximum number of positions allowed between matching tokens for phrases. Defaults to 0.

*   **WithMaxExpansions (int)**  
    _(Optional, Functional option)_ Maximum number of terms to which the last provided term will expand. Defaults to not expanding terms.

*   **WithZeroTermsQuery (ZeroTerms)**  
    _(Optional, Functional option)_ Indicates what to do when the analyzed text contains no terms. Valid values are:
    
    *   `none` (Default): No documents are returned if the analyzer removes all tokens.
    *   `all`: Returns all documents, similar to a match_all query.

)

query, err := effdsl.Define(
    effdsl.WithQuery(
        pq.PrefixQuery(
            "name",
            "al",
        ),
    ),
)

res, err := es.Search(
    es.Search.WithBody(strings.NewReader(query)),
)
```

### Parameters

*   **Field (string)**  
    _(Required, positional)_ The field you wish to search. This is a required parameter.

*   **Value (string)**  
    _(Required, positional)_ The prefix you wish to match against terms in the provided field. This is a required parameter.

*   **WithRewrite (Rewrite)**  
    _(Optional, Functional option)_ The method used to rewrite the query. Valid values are:
    *   `constant_score`: Query is rewritten to a constant score query.
    *   `scoring_boolean`: Query is rewritten to a scoring boolean query.
    *   `constant_score_boolean`: Query is rewritten to a constant score boolean query.
    *   `top_terms_N`: Query is rewritten to match the top N scoring terms.
    *   `top_terms_boost_N`: Query is rewritten to match the top N scoring terms with boosting.
    *   `top_terms_blended_freqs_N`: Query is rewritten to match the top N scoring terms with blended frequencies.

*   **WithCaseInsensitive (bool)**  
    _(Optional, Functional option)_ Whether the query is case insensitive. Defaults to false.
